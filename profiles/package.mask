# Per profile masking in overlays is currently not working
# with pkgcore/pkgdev/pkgcheck. Mask offending packages for all profiles
# as a workaround that both makes repoman happy and works with
# pkgcore/pkgdev/pkgcheck.
# Sorry for the inconvenience.
#
# TODO: Either fix per profile masking in overlays, or move
# relevant entries to the relevant package.mask files in ::gentoo

# Note: Do not use `Closes:` tag when treecleaning a package. Instead
# use the `Bug:` tag and use the RESOLVED/PKGREMOVED status on
# the bug manually if you can, or wait for someone else to do it.
